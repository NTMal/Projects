# Titanic Survival Prediction (82% Accuracy)
"""This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict passenger survival"""


### Key Results:
* **Final Accuracy:** 82%
* **Best Parameters:** "n_estimators: 200", "max_depth: 5", "min_samples_split: 5", "min_samples_leaf: 2"
* **Model Performance Note:** The model was fine-tuned for high **Precision (0.84)** in survival predictions, meaning it is highly reliable when it predicts a passenger lived.

### Project Structure:
- "/data": Kaggle csv files
- "/notebooks": end-to-end model pipeline (data cleaning, EDA, Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV)
